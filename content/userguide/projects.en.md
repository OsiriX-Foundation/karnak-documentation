This page lists all the projects configured in Karnak and allows to edit, create and delete them. A project is linked to a profile and contains a secret used for de-identification.

##### 1. Create a project

To create a new project, the project name field and the profile select box must be filled, then click on the button "Add". The project will be added to the list of projects and its details displayed in the right panel.

##### 2. Project list

All the projects available are listed here. By selecting a project in the list, its details are displayed on the right.

##### 3. Project details

In the details view, the project name and de-identification profile can be modified. The changes must then be saved using the "Update" button.

##### 4. Project secret

The project's secret is at the core of Karnak, more specifically for the de-identification process. It is a 32-character hexadecimal value.

The project's secret is automatically generated when the project is created. The date and time of the secret's creation are appended at the end of the secret in the details view.

A new secret can be generated by clicking the "Generate Secret" button. If new secrets are generated, previous secrets are saved in the database. Previous versions can be selected to be used.

A destination is associated with a project regarding the de-identification, as explained in the [Destination configuration](../gateway/destinations/#6-de-identification)

In order to generate new values, as well as pseudonymize certain patient information, a hash function is used with the secret as seed to have a project-wise unique yet determinist generated value. When the secret is changed, it must be taken into consideration that this determinist mechanism will be broken.
If a DICOM instance is de-identified twice using the same project, same secret and same profile, the resulting de-identified instances will be the equal. If the secret is changed, then the same DICOM instance de-identified twice, using the same project, same profile but a new secret will result in different de-identified instances.

Details about the algorithm and UID generation using the project's secret can be found [here](../../profiles/rules/#action-u-generate-a-new-uid).

##### 5. Action buttons

Any change done on the project's details must be persisted using the "Update" button.

The selected project can be deleted by clicking on the "Remove" button. If the project is associated to a destination, an error message will be displayed.
