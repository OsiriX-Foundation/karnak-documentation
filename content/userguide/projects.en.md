This page lists all projects configured in Karnak and lets you create, edit, and delete them.  
A project is linked to a profile and contains a secret used for de-identification.

##### 1. Create a project

To create a new project:
   1. Enter a project name.  
   2. Select a profile.  
   3. Click **Add**.

The project is added to the list and its details appear in the right panel.

##### 2. Project list

All available projects are listed in the left panel.  
Selecting a project displays its details on the right.

##### 3. Project details

In the details view you can:

- Change the project name.  
- Change the de-identification profile.

Click **Update** to save your changes.

##### 4. Project secret

The project secret is central to Karnak's de-identification process.  
It is a 32-character hexadecimal value.

- A secret is automatically generated when the project is created.  
- In the details view, the secret is shown along with its creation date and time.

You can generate a new secret by clicking **Generate Secret**. When you do this:

- Previous secrets are kept in the database.  
- You can select any previous secret to use again.

{{% notice note %}}
Changing the project secret can cause data consistency issues between old and new de-identified DICOM instances. Use this feature with caution and only when necessary.
{{% /notice %}}

A destination is associated with a project for de-identification, as described in the [Destination configuration](../gateway/destinations/#6-de-identification).

To generate new values and pseudonymize some patient information, Karnak uses a hash function seeded with the project secret. This makes the generated values unique per project and deterministic as long as the secret does not change.

Implications:

- If a DICOM instance is de-identified twice using the same project, secret, and profile, the resulting de-identified instances are identical.  
- If the secret changes, de-identifying the same DICOM instance again with the same project and profile but the new secret will produce different de-identified instances.

Details about the algorithm and UID generation using the project secret are available [here](../../profiles/rules/#action-u-generate-a-new-uid).

##### 5. Action buttons

- Click **Update** to save any change made to a project.  
- Click **Remove** to delete the selected project.

If the project is associated with a destination, deletion fails and an error message is displayed.
