description: Import and manage pseudonyms from CSV files or manual entry
---

This page allows you to create or import pseudonyms that Karnak will use during de-identification. The de-identification process and how pseudonyms are used is detailed in the [Pseudonym chapter](../../profiles/rules/#pseudonym).

De-identification is activated in the [Destination configuration](../gateway/destinations/#6-de-identification).

> [!INFO]
> Pseudonyms created or imported on this page are stored in a cache with a maximum lifetime of **7 days**.
> 
> With the [portable version of Karnak](../portable), the cache is persistent only the time the application is running. Restarting the application will clear the cache.

##### 1. Choose a project

External pseudonyms are linked to a specific project. This allows Karnak to properly handle cases where:
- A patient participates in multiple clinical studies with different pseudonyms
- Potential pseudonym collisions occur between projects

##### 2. Upload a CSV file

You can upload a CSV file containing external pseudonyms by:
- Clicking the **Upload File** button
- Dragging and dropping a file onto the upload area

###### 2.1 CSV separator configuration

After selecting a file, a dialog appears asking for the CSV separator character. The default value is a comma (`,`).

Click **Open CSV** to proceed to the import configuration.

###### 2.2 Preview and configuration

The CSV data is displayed in a grid for review and configuration.

**From line:** This field defines the starting row for the import. Use this to skip header rows or other non-data lines at the beginning of the file.

**Column assignments:** Map each CSV column to the corresponding pseudonym attribute. Only the **Patient ID** and **External Pseudonym** fields are required. Other fields are optional.

###### 2.3 Import validation

Click **Upload CSV** to import the data. Karnak performs validation checks including:
- Duplicate Patient IDs
- Duplicate Pseudonyms
- Required field validation

If validation errors occur, they will be displayed and the import will be rejected.

##### 3. Add a new patient manually

You can also add external pseudonyms manually by filling in the form fields:
- **External Pseudonym** (required)
- **Patient ID** (required)
- **Patient First Name** (optional)
- **Patient Last Name** (optional)
- **Issuer of Patient ID** (optional)

Click **Add patient** to add the entry to the external pseudonyms table.

##### 4. Pseudonym management

###### 4.1 Edit or delete individual entries

Each pseudonym row has action buttons:
- **Edit**: Modify the patient fields
- **Delete**: Remove the pseudonym from the cache

###### 4.2 Bulk operations

Select multiple rows using the checkboxes on the left side of each row. Click **Delete selected patients** to remove all selected entries and confirm the action in the dialog.

###### 4.3 Delete all patients

The **Delete all patients** button removes all external pseudonyms for the selected project only. Pseudonyms linked to other projects are not affected.
