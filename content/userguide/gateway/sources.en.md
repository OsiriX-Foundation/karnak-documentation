## Sources

The Sources tab displays all configured sources for the selected forward node.

![Sources view](/userguide/source_view.png)

A source is used to control which entities can send DICOM data to the forward node. It validates that received DICOM instances come from a known Application Entity Title (AET).

>  [!INFO]
> If no sources are defined, the forward node will accept DICOM instances from any AET without restrictions.


## Create a source

To create a new source, click the **Source** button and configure the following fields:

![Creation source](/userguide/source_main.png)

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **AETitle** | Application Entity Title of the source DICOM node | Yes |
| **Description** | Optional description to identify the source | No |
| **Hostname** | Hostname or IP address of the source DICOM node | No* |

*The Hostname field becomes required if you enable the **"Check the hostname"** option. When enabled, Karnak will validate both the AET and the hostname of incoming DICOM instances.

## Source validation behavior

When a DICOM instance is received by the forward node:

- **With sources configured**: Only instances from registered AETs (and hostnames, if enabled) are accepted
- **Without sources configured**: All instances are accepted.

This provides flexible security control for your DICOM workflow.
