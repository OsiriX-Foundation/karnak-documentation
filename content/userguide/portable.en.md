description: Run Karnak Gateway as a portable application
---

Karnak Gateway can be distributed as a portable application, allowing you to run it without installing it on your system. 

The purpose of this distribution is to provide an easy way to use Karnak Gateway for deidentification tasks on a local machine. It is typically used by researchers in collaborative projects that require a consistent method for de-identifying DICOM data with a shared de-identification profile.

> [!WARNING]
> The portable distribution is intended for personal use only on a single machine. For multiple gateway configurations, when using Karnak as a production service, please use the [standard installation method](../../installation) on a server and adapt the resource allocation accordingly.
