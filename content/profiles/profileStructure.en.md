description: Understanding the Profile Structure and YAML format
---

The [Profiles](../../userguide/profiles/) page allows you to manage de-identification profiles for your projects in the Karnak interface. This page explains the structure of these profiles and how to create or modify them using YAML files.

## Overview

A **profile** defines how DICOM attributes should be modified during de-identification or tag morphing. It consists of one or more **profile elements**, each specifying:

- Which DICOM attributes to target
- What action to apply (e.g., remove, replace, keep)
- Optional conditions for applying the action

**Important behavior:**

- Profile elements are **applied sequentially** in the order they appear in the YAML file
- Only the **first applicable** profile element modifies each DICOM attribute
- Once modified, subsequent profile elements won't affect that attribute

> [!INFO]
> Profiles must be YAML files that conform to the YAML specification and follow Karnak's profile structure defined here.

## Profile Metadata

Metadata fields help identify and manage your profiles. While optional, we recommend defining at least `name` and `version` for clarity.

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **name** | Profile name displayed in the UI | Optional (recommended) |
| **version** | Profile version number | Optional (recommended) |
| **minimumKarnakVersion** | Minimum Karnak version required | Optional |
| **defaultIssuerOfPatientID** | Default value when IssuerOfPatientID is missing in DICOM files. Used for building patient pseudonyms during de-identification | Optional |
| **profileElements** | List of profile elements to apply | Required |

## Profile Element Structure

Each profile element defines a specific de-identification rule.

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **name** | Descriptive name for this profile element |
| **codename** | Type identifier (see available types in this documentation) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description | When Required |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **condition** | Boolean expression to conditionally apply this element | Optional |
| **action** | Action type to perform (e.g., K, X, D, U, Z) | For certain codenames |
| **option** | Single configuration value | For certain codenames |
| **arguments** | Key-value pairs for advanced configuration | For certain codenames |
| **tags** | DICOM attributes this element should target | For certain codenames |
| **excludedTags** | DICOM attributes to skip (can be modified by later elements) | Optional |

### DICOM Tag Formats

Tags can be specified in multiple formats:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Parentheses | `(0010,0010)` | Standard DICOM notation |
| Comma-separated | `0010,0010` | Without parentheses |
| Concatenated | `00100010` | No separators |
| Pattern | `(0010,XXXX)` | All tags in group 0010 |
| Wildcard | `(XXXX,XXXX)` | All DICOM attributes |

### Conditions

Add optional conditions to control when a profile element applies. The expression is evaluated for each matching tag.

For complete syntax and examples, see the [Conditions](../conditions) page.

## Basic DICOM Profile

The [Basic DICOM Profile](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part15/chapter_E.html) is the DICOM standard's reference profile for removing Personally Identifying Information (PII) from DICOM files. 
The conditions to apply rules for a specific tag depend on its attribute type (Type 1, Type 2, etc.) based on the Information Object Definition (IOD). Karnak automatically determines the attribute type for each tag during de-identification.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend including this profile as the foundation for de-identification.

### Why Use It?

- Removes all attributes containing identifiable patient information
- Maintains DICOM conformance
- Industry-standard approach to de-identification

### How to Include

Reference it by codename in your profile:

```yaml
- name: "DICOM basic profile"
  codename: "basic.dicom.profile"
```

### Complete Example

Below is a minimal but complete profile that applies only the Basic DICOM Profile:

```yaml
name: "Dicom Basic Profile"
version: "1.0"
minimumKarnakVersion: "0.9.2"
defaultIssuerOfPatientID:
profileElements:
  - name: "DICOM basic profile"
    codename: "basic.dicom.profile"
```

> [!INFO]
> This profile should be placed at the end of your profile elements to ensure all other rules are applied first.
