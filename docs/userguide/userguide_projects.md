# Projects

When you want to use KARNAK's de-identification methods, you need to associate a project with your destination. This project defines the profile to be used as weel as the integrity of the data using a secret. The secret makes it possible to maintain consistency between the data to be de-identified, see [Action U, Generate a new UID](../profiles/rules#action-u-generate-a-new-uid) for more details.

The project page allows you to manage your projects. On this page, you can perform the following actions:

* [Create a new project](#1-create-a-project)
* [View the projects created](#2-project-list)
* [Edit a project](#3-project-metadata)
* [Edit project secret](#4-project-secret)
* [Remove a project](#5-action-buttons)

### 1. Create a project

To create a new project, you must give a project name and choose a profile that will be used for de-identification. To validate your choose, you can click on the button "Add". 

The list of profiles that you can associated with a project are the profiles that you have uploaded, see [Profile drag and drop area](profiles#1-profile-drag-and-drop-area).

### 2. Project list

All the projects available in your KARNAK instance are listed here. You can click on a project to view its details in the right panel.

### 3. Project metadata

You can change the project name and the de-identification profile using these inputs. By clicking on the "Update" button, see [Action buttons](#5-action-buttons),  you save your changes.

### 4. Project secret

The secret is generated automatically at the creation of a project. You can generate a new secret by using the "Generate Secret" button.

If new secrets are generated, previous secrets are saved in database in order to be able to use them again if needed.

The history of secrets is listed in the secret combobox with the creation date.
